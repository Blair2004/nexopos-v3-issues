## Requesting a customization ?
We're really happy that you've considered upgrading NexoPOS (or Gastro) to add the features 
that you want to make it fit your business. Before submitting your request, we would like you to take a deep
loop at the following note.

### 1 - Reserved to customers only
If you want us to customize NexoPOS, obviously you'll need to have a valid purchase code. This can be purchased
directly from CodeCanyon :

- [NexoPOS](https://codecanyon.net/item/nexopos-extendable-php-point-of-sale/16195010)
- [Gastro](https://codecanyon.net/item/gastro-restaurant-extension-for-nexopos/20242963)

You might need to authenticate on Nexo Platform and register your purchase code.

### 2 - Review the system
It might be a waste of time and money of what you're looking for already exist on the system. That's why we would like 
you to take a look at what is already implemented, in order to be sure that your needs is not covered.

### 3 - Customization Document
If you want you request to be handled, you need to provide it as a clear and well explained document. We might have an 
ideas of what you're looking for, but it's up to up to clarify what need to be made or not. How should the document be presented : 

#### A - Description of the need
Obviously, start by describe what you want. That will help us to have an overview of your need.

#### B - How does the need should be implemented ?
You might have a need, but that need should be merged to the current application. We might guess how the need can be implemented
but if you have any idea, sharing that will be really useful for us. You can also share some images of the implementation, or any 
explicit implementation like so : "add a new menu under the settings named 'Foo'..."

### Regarding the compatibility with updates
The customization is made to ensure the compatibility with the upcoming version, but your customization won't always be compatible, 
as the application grows. Upgrading your application might cost the some additionnal fees specially, after the project delivery.

### Regarding the support
Once the customization is delivered, the customer can still receive a support if the application doesn't work as the customer and our
team has agreed. We'll also fix any bugs occuring on the customized module. But that free support still valid 2 months after the customization delivery.

### Requesting Private customization
If you request a customization, you agree that we are allowed to use any of the ideas suggested to implemented it on the software so that everyone can benefit from. If NexoPOS has reached his current development level, it's because of others customers who has contributed with ideas, customization request and bug submittion. The point of having to pay for a customization is to ensure that you :

- Have NexoPOS fulfilling your needs as soon as possible
- Since we're the developpers of NexoPOS, the customization has a better ensurance of compatibility
- You'll receive a priority support
