## Requesting a customization ?
We're really happy that you've considered upgrading NexoPOS (or Gastro) to add the features 
that you want to make it fit your business. Before submitting your request, we would like you to take a deep
loop at the following note. 

## In which cases can you request a customization ?
Well NexoPOS is a growing POS application. We're usually retreiving ideas from our customers and sometime theses ideas are merged to the core. In fact, all customizations request are likely to be merged to the core specially when it's close to our guidelines. 
A customization is paid, if the customers would like to see the implementation of his features added as a separate module in a very short time.

### 1 - Reserved to customers only
If you want us to customize NexoPOS, obviously you'll need to have a valid purchase code. This can be purchased
directly from CodeCanyon :

- [NexoPOS](https://codecanyon.net/item/nexopos-extendable-php-point-of-sale/16195010)
- [Gastro](https://codecanyon.net/item/gastro-restaurant-extension-for-nexopos/20242963)

You might need to authenticate on Nexo Platform and register your purchase code.

### 2 - Review the system
It might be a waste of time and money of what you're looking for already exist on the system. That's why we would like 
you to take a look at what is already implemented, in order to be sure that your needs is not covered.

### 3 - Customization Document
If you want you request to be handled, you need to provide it as a clear and well explained document. We might have an 
ideas of what you're looking for, but it's up to up to clarify what need to be made or not. How should the document be presented : 

#### A - Description of the need
Obviously, start by describe what you want. That will help us to have an overview of your need.

#### B - How does the need should be implemented ?
You might have a need, but that need should be merged to the current application. We might guess how the need can be implemented
but if you have any idea, sharing that will be really useful for us. You can also share some images of the implementation, or any 
explicit implementation like so : "add a new menu under the settings named 'Foo'..."

### How is customization price set ?
The price depends on your needs. And we only accept payments made through our Payment Gateway (mentionned on the invoice). We won't then accept any alternative payment (buying more licences for example). There are however some fixed price as follows : 

| Services                                                       | Price         | Realisation | 
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |-------------|
| Creating a dedicated module (only once for each customization) | 30 USD        | 2 hours     |
| Customizing a receipt (Adjusting the UI)                       | 30 USD        | 1 - 3 days  |
| Modification involving Database                                | 40 USD (from) | 2 - 4 days  |
| Modification involving adjusting the UI                        | 10 USD (from) | 1 - 2 days  |

| Third Party Library (API) integration                          | 60 USD (from) | 3 - 7 days  |

### Regarding the compatibility with updates
The customization is made to ensure the compatibility with the upcoming version, but your customization won't always be compatible, 
as the application grows. Upgrading your application might cost the some additionnal fees specially, after the project delivery.

### Regarding the support
Once the customization is delivered, the customer can still receive a support if the application doesn't work as the customer and our
team has agreed. We'll also fix any bugs occuring on the customized module. But that free support still valid 2 months after the customization delivery.

### Requesting Private customization
If you request a customization, you agree that we are allowed to use any of the ideas suggested to implemented it on the software so that everyone can benefit from. If NexoPOS has reached his current development level, it's because of others customers who has contributed with ideas, customization request and bug submittion. The point of having to pay for a customization is to ensure that you :

- Have NexoPOS fulfilling your needs as soon as possible
- Since we're the developpers of NexoPOS, the customization has a better ensurance of compatibility
- You'll receive a priority support

### What we're not doing
Before moving ahead, you might need to read what is not allowed : 

- The customer cannot require a customization to be made before having a licence. 
- You might need to take a look at the demo to have a better understand on how that works and based on that you can request a customization. 
- The price of the customization is NOT included on the price of the licence (purchase code). 
- We do not deliver licences (purchase code) outside from CodeCanyon. 
- We do not (yet) deliver trial licences or trial versions for NexoPOS 3.x
- A customization request once approved by the customer can't be canceled (refunded)
- The payment of the customization is entirely paid, unless the payment exceed 200 USD. In that case the payment can be made in 2 slices.
- We're not responsible of the mistakes made by the customer on his explanations. 
- If the customization has already started, a modification on the requirements might be subject to another deal with the customer. 
- We have the discretion to approve or not a modification of the requirements already explained by the customer, while the customization is ongoing.
